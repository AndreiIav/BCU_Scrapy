1. In order for the scripts and spider to run, the following environment variables
   need to be set:
   BASE_PATH (pointing to the project root folder)
   DATABASE_NAME
   These can be set in an .env file that needs to be present in root_folder\src\scripts
2. In order for the scrapper to run, a sqlite database needs to exist in root_folder.
   A new database with the correct schema can be created by running the 'create_database.py' script.
3. In order for the scrapper to run, a 'wanted_magazines.txt' file needs to exists in root_folder.
   The file and the names of magazines needed for scrapping can be added manually (every magazine name
   on a new line).
   Or, by running the 'create_wanted_magazines_file.py' script a new 'wanted_magazines.txt' file will be
   created by checking what magazine name exists at "https://documente.bcucluj.ro/periodice.html" but not
   in the magazines table.
   Also, the 'create_wanted_magazines_file.py' script checks if a 'list_of_magazines_not_to_be_scrapped.txt'
   exists in root_folder\extra. This file is optional and needs to be added manually in case it needs to be
   used (every magazine name on a new line).
4.To run the scrapper:
   - activate the venv from root_folder
   - go to root_folder\src\BcuSpider and run 'scrapy crawl bcu' in cmd
