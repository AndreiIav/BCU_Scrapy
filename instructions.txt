1.To run the scrapper:
   - activate the venv from base_folder
   - go to base_folder\src\BcuSpider and run 'scrapy crawl bcu' in cmd
2. In order for the scrapper to run, a sqlite database needs to exist in base_folder.
   A new database with the correct schema can be created by running the 'create_database.py'script.
3. In order for the scrapper to run, a 'wanted_magazines.txt' file needs to exists in base_folder.
   The file and the names of magazines needed for scrapping can be added manually (every magazine name on a
   new line).
   Or, by running the 'create_wanted_magazines_file.py' script a new 'wanted_magazines.txt' file will be
   created by checking what magazine name exists at "https://documente.bcucluj.ro/periodice.html" but not
   in the magazines table.
